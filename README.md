# Tech_Blog

As a developer writing about tech is just as important as creating it. 
I wanted to create an app that as a developer I could publish blog posts
and comment on other developers posts as well.
An app that was simple with just a click of a button I create a new blog post and the the contents of my post were saved.
I am able to to delete and update my posts from the dashboard and when I am done I simply click logout ad I am signed out of the site.
